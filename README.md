D3.js examples
==============

Note that Chrome and some other browsers are extremely strict about where
JavaScript can load data files from. If the examples don't work for you, try
firing up a little web server with:

	$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

and then navigate to the page that you were trying to visit at
http://localhost:8000/.
